	FRAMEBUFFER_SIZE	= $5400 ; is actually $6100 (should be $6000?), need to limit plotting to $5400 by limiting x to 224
	FRAMEBUFFER			= $702000
	;.res ((256*194)/2)-FRAMEBUFFER_SIZE ; screen should be 256*192?? why is it taking the space of a 256*194 screen?
	;using SCBR $00, $6100 (add $400 per increment on SCBR) and onward looks safe, should probably limit plotting to $5400 bytes though.
	;$6000 should technically be safe but seems to plot past this by $100 bytes in some emulators (including bsnes, but not snes9x).
	;since the gsu thinks the screen is 256x192 ((256*192)/2 = $6000), it plots past the $5400 size of a 224x192 screen unless you limit X. Save sram or save cycles, choose wisely.
	;(256*194)/2 = $6100
	;plotting seems to wrap around to $CFF $2C00+6100 = $8D00, with SCBR $2C00.
