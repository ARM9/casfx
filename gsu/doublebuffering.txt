GSU operation:
start:
	Render frame
	set frame rendered flag
	STOP, wait for go flag, go flag only set after SCPU NMI
	goto start

SCPU operation:
start:
	wait for IRQ
	
	IRQ received, check signature
		if IRQ source = GSU {
			then do nothing in particular (for now, also masked IRQ).
			goto start
		} else if IRQ = ppu {
			set interrupt disable flag to avoid irq messing something up
			set up hv data for next IRQ.
			
			if scanning location = top of screen {
				wait for hblank, set screen brightness to inidisp_mirror.
			} else if scanning location = bottom of screen {
				wait for hblank, set force blank.
				wait for gsu STOP (for now).
				transfer current half of framebuffer to VRAM, increment index (1 bit).
				update VRAM map base register and doublebuffer index for next field.
			}
		}
	goto start
